## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

I learned how to use flexbox and grid layouts, but I very much so prefer grid. I also learned how to move chunks of code into an element.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>

<div class="vertically-centered">
  <article class="card Calculator">
    <section class="content">
      <h3>Calculator</h3>
      <p>Uses data from past projects to provide better delivery estimates</p>
      <img src="./images/icon-calculator.svg" alt="" />
    </section>
  </article>
</div>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  .Karma::before {
    display: block;
    content: "";
    background: hsl(34, 97%, 64%);
    height: 0.25rem;
  }
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```
